The desire to understand the fundamental building blocks and underlying structures of our world has driven humanity's exploration of physics at the smallest scales. What started out as a pursuit of ideas purely within the mind in ancient Greece has developed into a fruitful interplay of both experiment and theory in modern particle physics. Today the Standard Model of particle physics describes the known particles and their interactions and has withstood countless experimental challenges. However, theoretical concerns and the desire to incorporate experimental observations not yet described within the Standard Model have lead to the conviction that yet unknown physical effects will manifest themselves if particle interactions are probed at energy scales of $\mathcal{O}$(TeV).

This is the purpose of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which collides protons at centre-of-mass energies of several TeV. In addition to many precision measurements of established phenomena at this previously inaccessible energy scale, discovering the Higgs boson and thereby completing the Standard Model has been a large success of this undertaking. Now the focus lies even more on going beyond the Standard Model into the realm of new physics. Many ideas exists on how to extend the existing theory and an extensive search program is conducted in search of the new particles and interactions predicted by those models. 

One of the most attractive concepts is that of Supersymmetry, which introduces a symmetry between fermions and bosons. In this framework, a partner particle to each of the known Standard Model particles exists, differing in spin by $\frac{1}{2}\hbar$. In principle these partners have the same mass as their Standard Model counterparts. However, none of them have been discovered yet, implying that Supersymmetry is broken, which allows for heavier partners.

In this analysis, evidence for the existence of heavy supersymmetric particles is sought, exploiting a characteristic signature of their decay. In the decay of a neutralino particle, two charged leptons of the same flavour and opposite sign can be produced together with a lighter neutralino which escapes detection. This correlated production of the leptons results in a characteristic edge in the distribution of their invariant mass.

The full data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8\TeV recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumi, is used. The presence of a supersymmetric signal in the data is assessed in two ways. First, event counts in different selections are compared to the expectation from Standard Model backgrounds. In a second approach, the characteristic edge signature is used in a shape analysis to separate a possible signal from the backgrounds. In the both cases, the background contributions are estimate entirely from data. 

This work builds upon the previous achievements by Nikals Mohr and Daniel Sprenger in their doctoral theses~\cite{Mohr:1423334,Sprenger:1501963} and has been performed in part in collaboration with Marco-Andrea Buchmann~\cite{Buchmann:1704399}. The results have been published by the CMS collaboration~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lwa}. This analysis presents an update of the published result, taking into account a later reprocessing of the data sample with improved calibrations. However, the analysis techniques have not been altered and the outcome of the analysis remains unchanged.

\section{Defintion of variables}
\label{sec:variables}
Throughout this thesis, quantities are expressed in natural units. In this system, the speed of light and the reduced Planck constant are set to unity:
\begin{equation}
c = \hbar = 1.
\end{equation} 
Energies and momenta are measured in \GeV and lengths in $\text{\GeV}^{-1}$. However, lengths are also given in meters or centimeters, if convenient. 

The cross section of a physical process is given in barn, $\unit{1}{\barn}$ corresponding to $\unit{10^{-24}}{\centi\meter\squared}$.   

The CMS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system where the x- and y-axis point perpendicular to the beam direction towards the center of the LHC and upwards, respectively. The z-axis points in the direction of the counter-clockwise beam.  These coordinates are usually transformed into a spherical coordinate system where $\phi$ is the azimuthal and $\theta$ is the polar angle. Instead of $\theta$ the pseudorapidity 
\begin{equation}
\eta = -ln \left( \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
is commonly used, which coincides with the rapidity $y = \frac{1}{2} ln\left(\frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z}\right)$ for $E\approx |p|$. The geometric distance of objects in the detector is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \sqrt{(\phi_1 - \phi_2)^2 + (\eta_1 - \eta_2)^2}
\end{equation}

As the collisions at hadron colliders involve interactions of partons carrying unknown fractions of the proton's momenta, the momentum of the initial state along the beam axis is unknown. As the momenta of the partons transverse to the beam are negligible compared to those in z direction, the transverse plane provides a well defined initial state. Therefore the transverse momentum and energy
\begin{eqnarray}
\pt = \sqrt{p_x^2  + p_y^2} = p\cdot \sin\left(\theta\right), & \Et = \sqrt{E_x^2  + E_y^2} = E\cdot \sin\left(\theta\right)
\end{eqnarray}
are often used. The vectorial sum of the particle's \pt must be zero because of conservation of linear momentum. Therefore the missing transverse energy 
\begin{equation}
\METVec = - \sum\limits_{\text{particles}} \vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}
\end{equation}
is defined as a quantity sensitive to particles leaving the experiment undetected, but also mismeasurements and resolution effects. Usually the absolute value $\MET = \vert \METVec \vert$ is used.

The amount of energy deposited in an event is characterized by the scalar sum of the \pt of all selected hadronic jets (see section~\ref{sec:PF}) 
\begin{equation}
\HT = \sum\limits_{\text{jets}} \vert \pt \vert.
\end{equation}

%In some of the algorithms used in the triggers which select events for storage (see section~\ref{sec:trigger}), the variable $\alpha_\mathrm{T}$ is used. It is calculated for events with two jets as
%\begin{equation}
%\alpha_{\mathrm{T}} = E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j2}} / M_{T},
%\end{equation}
%where $E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j2}}$ is the transverse energy of the less energetic of the jets and $M_{\mathrm{T}}$ is the transverse mass of the dijet system defined as
%\begin{equation}
%M_{\mathrm{T}} = \sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^2 E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j}i}\right)^2 - \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^2 p_{\mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{j}i}\right)^2 - \left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^2 p_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{j}i}\right)^2}.
%\end{equation}
%For events with more than two jets, jets are combined into pseudojets in a way that minimizes the \Et difference between the two pseudojets.
