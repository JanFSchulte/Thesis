  abstract={The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

  abstract={The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva is the world's newest and most powerful tool for Particle Physics research. It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 10 34 cm −2 s −1 . It can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of 10 27 cm −2 s −1 . In this paper, the machine design is described.}
