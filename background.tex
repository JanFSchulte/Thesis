\label{sec:backgrounds}
Different SM processes contribute to the event sample in the signal region, as indicated for example in Figure~\ref{fig:sigRegionBG}. To distinguish a potential signal from these backgrounds, a precise estimation of the background contributions is essential. While the simulation of these processes and the response of the CMS detector gives a good description of the data for the majority of the phase space, a large number of uncertainty sources are introduced in the modelling of the physical processes and the detector. Therefore, a higher precision can be achieved by deriving the background estimates directly from the recorded data. Dedicated methods are applied for the flavour-symmetric and Drell--Yan backgrounds (see Section~\ref{sec:SMBackgrounds}). The results of these methods are used directly in the counting experiment (see Section~\ref{sec:counting}). The fit in search for a kinematic edge performs shape based estimates of the SM backgrounds. However, the results of the studies of flavour-symmetry described below are used to constrain these backgrounds in the fit procedure.

\section{Flavour-symmetric backgrounds}
Processes that are symmetric in the production of SF and OF lepton pairs allow for the estimation of their contribution to the SF event sample from the OF yield. The relevant backgrounds contributing to this class have been discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SMBackgrounds}. Additional contributions are coming from misidentified leptons, as will be demonstrated later. 

No significant deviation from flavour-symmetry has been observed in the decays of the \W boson, with a measured ratio of the branching fractions into $e+\nu$ and $\mu + \nu$ of $\frac{BF(\W\rightarrow e\nu)}{BF(\W\rightarrow \mu\nu)} = 1.007\pm0.021$~\cite{PDG}. In the decays of the $\tau$ lepton the different masses of electron and muon have a small, but noticeable effect, resulting in a slightly favoured decay into electrons with ratio of branching fractions of  $\frac{BF(\tau\rightarrow e\nu)}{BF(\tau\rightarrow \mu\nu)} = 1.0241\pm0.0032$~\cite{PDG}. As backgrounds with $\tau$ leptons are a sub-dominant contribution to the flavour-symmetric background, these can be considered to be fully flavour-symmetric on particle level. 

However, deviations from flavour-symmetry are introduced by the different efficiencies for triggering, reconstructing, and identifying electrons and muons in CMS. The background estimation from OF events $N_{SF}^{pred}$, therefore, has to include a correction for this deviation, which is applied as a multiplicative factor to the observed OF event yield $N_{OF}$:
\begin{equation*}
N_{SF}^{\text{pred}} = \Rsfof \cdot N_{OF}.
\end{equation*}
Similarly, the factors \Reeof and \Rmmof are used to derive separate background estimates for the \EE and \MM channels. Two independent methods are utilised to measure \Rsfof on data. In the first approach the ratio is directly measured as the ratio of SF to OF events in the control region for flavour-symmetric backgrounds (see Table~\ref{tab:selections}). The second approach studies the lepton efficiencies and derives \Rsfof factorised into the effects of trigger efficiencies and reconstruction and identification efficiencies. 

\subsection{Direct measurement of \Rsfof}
The ratio \Rsfof is calculated in the control region for flavour-symmetric backgrounds. As an initial step, possible dependencies of \Rsfof are studied in simulation, as the statistical uncertainties are lower compared to the data. The ratio of SF to OF events in the flavour-symmetric control region as a function of \mll in simulation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:controlRatioMC}, separately for the central and forward lepton selection. The ratio is very close to one and independent of \mll, except at the \Z boson peak, where a significant Drell--Yan contribution spoils the SF-OF symmetry. It can be concluded that an universal factor can be applied for flavour-symmetric backgrounds over the full mass range. To exclude the \Z boson peak from the calculation only events in the mass regions $\unit{20}{\giga\electronvolt}< \mll < \unit{70}{\giga\electronvolt}$ and $\mll > \unit{120}{\giga\electronvolt}$ are considered.

\label{fig:controlRatioMC}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The observed ratio in data as a functions of \mll is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:controlRatio}. As expected from the simulation, no significant dependence on \mll is observed both in the central and forward signal lepton selection.
\begin{figure}

\label{fig:controlRatio}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The numerical results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:rSFOF} for \Rsfof as well as for \Reeof and \Rmmof. Agreement between the values measured in data and simulation is observed within the statistical uncertainties. The observed values in data are $\Rsfof = 1.007\pm0.037$ for the central and $1.015\pm0.062$ for the forward dilepton selection. 

The extrapolation of the measured value of \Rsfof into the signal region is tested in simulation by calculating the ratio of \Rsfof observed in the signal region to that in the control region. No deviation of the values measured in the signal region from those obtained in the control region is observed within the statistical uncertainties of the simulation. This statistical uncertainty of 0.020 for the central and 0.034 for the forward dilepton selection is therefore assigned as a systematic uncertainty of the method. 

\input{tab/table_Rsfof_full.tex}

\subsection{Determination of \Rsfof with the factorisation method}
\label{sec:rmue}
Asymmetries between the lepton flavours introduced by differing reconstruction and selection efficiencies can be corrected for if the ratio of efficiencies for muons and electrons $\rmuestar = \frac{\epsilon_{\mu}}{\epsilon_{e}}$ is known. Here and in the following, the ``$^{*}$'' indicates that only reconstruction and selection efficiencies are considered in this definition. As all measurable quantities are affected by trigger efficiencies, these have to taken into account separately. The observable yield of OF events is therefore expressed as 
\begin{equation*}
N_{OF} = \epsilon_{e\mu}^T N_{OF}^{*},
\end{equation*}
where $\epsilon_{e\mu}^T$ is the efficiency of the $e\mu$ dilepton triggers. Similarly, \effeet and \effmmt denote the efficiencies of the dielectron and dimuon triggers.

Under the assumption that the efficiencies for the two leptons in the event have negligible correlation and the dilepton efficiency factorises, i.e. $\epsilon_{\ell\ell} = \epsilon_{\ell}\cdot\epsilon_{\ell}$, \rmuestar can be expressed in terms of the measured value \rmue, which is derived from the \EE and \MM event yields in the Drell-Yan control region (see Section~\ref{sec:rmue}) as 
\begin{equation*}
\rmue  = \sqrt{\frac{N_{\mu\mu}}{N_{ee}}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{\mu}^2 \effmmt}{\epsilon_{e}^2 \effeet}} = \rmuestar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\effmmt}{\effeet}}.
\end{equation*}

The predicted number of dielectron and dimuon events can be expressed in terms of the opposite-flavour yield using the relations
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\epsilon_{ee}^T} N_{ee}^{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\epsilon_{e\mu}^T} \frac{N_{OF}}{\rmuestar} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{\rmue} \sqrt{\frac{\effmmt}{\effeet}} \frac{1}{\epsilon_{e\mu}^T} N_{OF}
\end{equation*}
and 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^T} N_{\mu\mu}^{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rmuestar \frac{1}{\epsilon_{e\mu}^T} \cdot N_{OF} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rmue \sqrt{\frac{\effeet}{\effmmt}} \frac{1}{\effemt} \cdot N_{OF}.
\end{equation*}
The combined prediction for the same-flavour yield is therefore given by
\begin{equation*}
N_{SF}^{\text{pred}} = N_{ee}^{\text{pred}} + N_{\mu\mu}^{\text{pred}}.
\end{equation*}

In summary, the final expressions for the predicted yields in the same-flavour channels become
\begin{equation}
N_{ee}^{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2\rmue} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\effeet \effmmt}}{\effemt} N_{OF} = \Reeof N_{OF}
\label{eq:nee}
\end{equation} 
and
\begin{equation}
N_{\mu\mu}^{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2}\rmue  \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\effeet \effmmt}}{\effemt} N_{OF} = \Rmmof N_{OF}.
\label{eq:nmm}
\end{equation} 
The combined prediction of the SF yield is, therefore:
\begin{equation}
N_{SF}^{\text{pred}} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\rmue + \frac{1}{\rmue}\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\effeet \effmmt}}{\effemt}  N_{OF} = \Rsfof N_{OF}.
\label{eq:nsf}
\end{equation}
The factor containing the trigger efficiencies is abbreviated as
\begin{equation}
R_{\mathrm{T}} = \frac{\sqrt{\effeet \effmmt}}{\effemt}.
\label{eq:RT}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Measurement of $\mathbf{r_{\mu e}}$}
The measurement of \rmue is performed in the Drell-Yan control region (see Table~\ref{tab:selections}) as the ratio of \MM to \EE events on the Z boson peak, requiring $\unit{60}{\giga\electronvolt} < \mll < \unit{120}{\giga\electronvolt}$. A comparison of the recorded data to the different contributions  from SM processes, estimated from simulation, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rmueMll}. The Drell-Yan process is the dominating source of events in this selection. Good agreement between data and simulation is observed, indicating a good understanding of this kinematic region by the CMS simulation. Towards higher masses the data is underestimated by the simulation because mass-dependent higher order effects are not included in the simulation and result in a lack of events in the simulated samples.

The black lines indicate the region in \mll used in the measurement of \rmue.}
\label{fig:rmueMll}
\end{figure} 
The results of the calculation of \rmue are shown in Table~\ref{tab:rMuE}. Given are the observed yields for \MM and \EE events and the resulting value of \rmue with statistical and systematic uncertainties. In the central lepton selection, the \MM yield is about 18\% higher than the \EE yield. Similar results are observed on Drell-Yan simulation. For events with leptons in the forward region, a larger asymmetry between muons and electrons is observed, as expected since the harsher pileup environment in the detector endcaps has a stronger effect on the electron efficiencies. Here the \MM yield is about 40\% higher than the \EE yield. 
\input{tab/table_rMuE_result.tex}
The systematic uncertainties assigned to the measured values of \rmue are 10\% for the central and 20\% for the forward lepton selection. These values are obtained by studying the dependency of \rmue on relevant observables. These are on the one hand properties of the lepton pairs, while on the other hand event properties as the jet multiplicity and \MET are studied to ensure the applicability of \rmue in the signal region. The dependencies of \rmue on \mll, \MET, and \njets are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rmueDependencies}. Some dependency is observed in the case of \mll, where the values are higher for low \mll below the \Z boson mass. This can be traced back to a dependency on the \pt of the leptons, where the efficiencies for muons have sharper turn-ons compared to electrons. In data, there is a strong effect visible around the \Z boson mass for forward leptons. This is caused by a systematic shift of the position of the \Z boson peak between electrons and muons and is not a general property of \rmue, as is evident from the comparison with $t\bar{t}$ simulation shown in the upper right of Figure~\ref{fig:rmueDependencies}. No strong dependencies can be observed for \MET and \njets within the statistical uncertainties. All observed deviations from the central values are covered by the systematic uncertainties assigned to the measurement. Further information on the dependency studies can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:rmue}.

\label{fig:rmueDependencies}
\end{figure} 
\subsubsection{Measurement of \RT}
\label{sec:triggerEffs}
The trigger efficiencies are measured utilizing an event sample collected with the \HT triggers discussed in Section~\ref{sec:trigger}. Lepton pairs corresponding to the flavour combination of the trigger in question are selected. To ensure that only correctly reconstructed events are considered in the calculation of the trigger efficiencies, the events are required to have $\HT > \unit{200}{\giga\electronvolt}$. This excludes events which are completely different in their properties on trigger and analysis level and at the same time is lower than the threshold applied in the trigger because the \HT definition on trigger level differs from the one used offline. To ensure that the factorisation method is performed on event samples completely orthogonal to the signal region and the flavour-symmetric control region, events with $\njets \geq 2$ and $\MET > \unit{100}{\giga\electronvolt}$ are rejected. This ensures that the direct measurement of \Rsfof and the factorisation method remain statistically independent. As the offline lepton selection has more strict requirements compared to the one applied at HLT level, the dilepton triggers should have accepted all these events. The trigger efficiency is therefore defined as the ratio of accepted events by the total number of events:
\begin{equation*}
\epsilon_{\ell\ell}^T = \frac{N_{\text{events}}(H_T\text{ trigger} \cap \ell\ell\text{ selection} \cap \ell\ell\text{ trigger})}{N_{\text{events}}(H_T\text{ trigger} \cap \ell\ell\text{ selection})}.
\end{equation*}
In case of \MM and OF events, two triggers are used in the event selection. Therefore, their combined efficiency is measured, requiring the logical OR of both. The resulting efficiencies are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:EffValues_Seperated}, separately for the central and forward lepton selections. As discussed in Section~\ref{{sec:trigger}}, the \HT had to be prescaled during the data taking. The efficiencies on simulation are therefore measured with much higher statistical precision, as this prescales are not applied there. The trigger efficiencies for \EE and \MM are about 97\% in both the central and forward selection. The efficiency for OF events is lower, about 95\% in the central and 90\% in the forward selection. This shows how the flavour symmetry is broken at trigger level by the inclusion of the additional dimuon trigger, which recovers efficiency for the trailing muon leg of the trigger and is not present in the OF triggers.   
\input{tab/table_TriggerEffsExclusive_Seperated.tex}
To assess the systematic uncertainties of the trigger efficiency measurement, potential biases due to the choice of the orthogonal trigger  are studied on simulation, using dileptonic $t\bar{t}$ events. On simulation the efficiency can be measured without the requirement of the \HT triggers, as no trigger is needed to select the events. The ratio of the efficiencies measured with the \HT triggers to those true efficiencies as a function of \mll is shown on the left side of Figure~\ref{fig:triggerEffBias}, separately for SF and OF events. In both cases all deviations from unity are in the order of 0.1\% and well compatible with unity inside the statistical uncertainties. No bias of the efficiency measurement due to the \HT triggers is observed and therefore no systematic uncertainty due to this choice is assigned to the measurement.

\label{fig:triggerEffBias}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The turn-on of the triggers at low lepton \pt is of particular interest because asymmetries between the lepton flavours are more likely to occur in this difficult environment. The dependence of the trigger efficiency on the \pt of the trailing lepton can be studied using datasets triggered by single lepton triggers. Triggers with \pt thresholds of $\unit{24 (27)}{\giga\electronvolt}$ for muons (electrons) are available. These thresholds are relatively low for single lepton triggers, resulting in very strict selection criteria applied on HLT level. Dilepton events are selected, in which the leading lepton can be matched  geometrically to the trigger object that fired the single lepton trigger. The trailing lepton is matched to trigger objects that have fired the trailing leg of the dilepton trigger. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of events in which the dilepton trigger has fired, over the total number of dilepton events. The resulting efficiency curves are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:triggerEffTrailing} for four different trailing lepton trigger legs and combining the central and forward selection. The asymptotic efficiency for trailing electrons is virtually the same for the dielectron and OF triggers (black and light blue markers). The same is not true for trailing muons in the dimuon and OF triggers (red and dark blue markers), caused by the increased efficiency for trailing muons in the $\mu\mu$ channel, which is significantly higher than those in the trigger paths not using the tracker information, as expected. Trailing muons have a much sharper turn-on than trailing electrons and are fully efficient already at a \pt of $\unit{10}{\giga\electronvolt}$. For electrons the plateau is reached only at about $\unit{\approx 30}{\giga\electronvolt}$. The turn-on is steeper for trailing electrons in the dielectron trigger compared to those in the OF trigger, resulting in an increased deviation from flavour symmetry below $\unit{20}{\giga\electronvolt}$. As the precision and stability of the background prediction was given priority over lepton acceptance in the design of the analysis, events with trailing leptons in this \pt range are rejected.

\label{fig:triggerEffTrailing}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

To assess the systematic uncertainties of the trigger efficiency measurement, the dependency of \RT, as used in the calculation of \Rsfof, on different observables is tested. Here a dataset triggered by $\alpha_\mathrm{T}$ triggers is used, as the \HT triggers do not provide enough events for these studies. The use of this triggers is motivated by the fact that they also rely on hadronic event properties and are therefore exhibit no significant correlation with the dilepton triggers, as is the case with the \HT triggers. This is illustrated on the right side of Figure~\ref{fig:triggerEffBias}, where the efficiencies measured using the $\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}$ triggers are compared to the true efficiency as a function of \mll. As $\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}$ is designed to suppress SM backgrounds, the available statistics for this test is low compared to the case of the \HT triggers. However, no significant deviation from unity is observed, which validates the use of the $\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}$ triggers for this studies.

A 5\% systematic uncertainty is assigned to each trigger efficiency, resulting in an uncertainty of 6.4\% on \RT, covering all observed deviations from the measured value of \RT within the statistical uncertainties, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RTDependencies}. Studies of further variables can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:RT}. The mean \RT values displayed in the figures are obtained using the $\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}$ trigger as baseline and therefore differ from the nominal result obtained using the \HT triggers.

\end{figure} 
\subsubsection{Results of the factorisation method}
The results of the factorisation methods are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:factorisation}. The factor $R_T$ is calculated from the trigger efficiencies in Table~\ref{tab:EffValues_Seperated} via Equation~\ref{eq:RT}. The resulting correction factors \Rsfof, \Reeof, and \Rmmof are calculated as described in Equations~\ref{eq:nee}-\ref{eq:nsf}.  
\input{tab/table_factorization_result.tex}
As for the direct measurements in the control region, the observed deviations of \Rsfof from one are small and inside the uncertainties of the method in the central region. In the forward region, a deviation from unity of 10\% is observed both on data and in simulation, as expected from the larger differences in the efficiencies of electrons and muons in this region. Because the uncertainty on \rmue cancels out to a large degree in the calculation \Rsfof, the total uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on \RT, while for \Reeof and \Rmmof the uncertainty of \rmue is the dominant one. This results in much larger uncertainties on the latter two factors. The dependency of \Rsfof on \rmue and \RT as given by Equation~\ref{eq:nsf} is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rmuePropaganda}. The measured values of \rmue and \Rsfof are shown as straight lines, surrounded by bands indicating their uncertainties. The red line shows the value of \Rsfof corresponding to a given \rmue, under the assumption that the trigger efficiencies stay constant. The dashed black lines show the impact, that the uncertainties on the trigger efficiencies have on the resulting \Rsfof. It can be seen that variations of \rmue inside the systematic uncertainties have only little effect on \Rsfof, while changes in the trigger efficiencies have a much larger impact.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{Combined correction factors and resulting background estimates}
\label{sec:combinedRSFOF}
An overview of the resulting corrections factors of the measurement in the control region and the factorisation method are shown in Table~\ref{tab:combinedRSFOF}. In all cases the results of the two methods agree very well within their uncertainties. 

Given the fact that they are performed on exclusive datasets and under the assumption that their uncertainties follow a Gaussian distribution, which is justified by the fact that they are either statistical in nature (and the samples sizes are sufficiently large), or assigned to cover statistical fluctuations in the dependency studies of \rmue and \RT, they can be combined using a weighted average. 
\input{tab/table_rSFOF_combination_result.tex} 
A precision of about 4\% and 6\% on the translation from opposite flavour to same flavour is reached in the central and forward dilepton selection, respectively. Separating the lepton flavours, the uncertainty in \Reeof and \Rmmof is about 6\% for central and 9-10\% for forward leptons. This increase is caused by the missing cancellation of the uncertainty on \rmue and the increased statistical uncertainty in the direct measurement in the control region. However, only \Rsfof is used in the background estimates for both counting experiment and the shape analysis and the separate \EE and \MM channels are only studied as cross-checks. Therefore, the increased uncertainty in the separate channels has no impact on the sensitivity of the result.

Given that the weighted average is calculated separately for each flavour combination, \Reeof and \Rmmof do not add up exactly to \Rsfof, which in turn means that the sum of the background estimates for flavour-symmetric backgrounds in the \EE and \MM channels does not equal that in the SF channel. The OF yields in the \mll bins of the counting experiment together with the resulting background estimates in the different dilepton channels are shown in Table~\ref{tab:FlavSymBackgrounds}. 
\input{tab/table_cutNCount_FlavSymBkgs.tex}




\subsection{Validation of background estimates}
\label{sec:validation}
To judge the performance of the estimation methods for flavour-symmetric backgrounds, they are applied to simulation. In Table~\ref{tab:MCClosure} the resulting SF yields and the background estimation from OF yields, SF$^{\text{pred}}$, after application of the signal selection are shown separately for the central and forward dilepton selection. The SF$^{\text{pred}}$ values have been derived using the \Rsfof values obtained on simulation shown in Table~\ref{tab:combinedRSFOF}. For completely flavour-symmetric processes, such as \ttbar, $\Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow \tau\tau$, or single top-quark production, the difference between SF and SF$^{\text{pred}}$ is compatible with zero within the statistical uncertainties of the simulation and the systematic uncertainties of the method. Other systematic uncertainties affecting the simulation are the same for SF and OF lepton pairs and are therefore not considered here. 
\input{tab/table_MC_SFOF_Full2012.tex}
 As expected, deviations from flavour-symmetry are observed only for processes containing a \Z boson, most notable $\Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow \ell\ell$, but also $\mathrm{WZ}$ or $\mathrm{ZZ}$ production and more rare processes like $t\bar{t}$\Z production. It can therefore be concluded that the background prediction for flavour-symmetric processes performs well within the uncertainties of the methods presented above. The validity of this cross-check is restricted to processes well modelled in simulation. As the modelling of leptons not produced in the hard physics process is in general less reliable, more detailed studies are performed on data to ensure that flavour-symmetry also holds for the small contribution of non-prompt leptons, to the final event selection.
\subsubsection*{Study of non-prompt leptons}
As a preface to studies performed on data, the flavour-symmetry of non-prompt leptons is examined using the truth information of the simulation. A data driven estimate is derived from leptons with relaxed isolation criteria.
\paragraph*{Non-prompt leptons in simulation}
The origin of the leptons in the events contributing to the signal selection is studied in simulation by matching the reconstructed lepton to the generated particles with the smallest spatial separation $\Delta R$. The difference in generated and reconstructed \pt must not exceed twice the generated \pt. Information on the origin of the matched generated particle is used to determine if the lepton originates from a decay of a \Z or \W boson or a $\tau$ lepton, a decay of a heavy flavour quark inside a jet, or a jet that was misidentified as a lepton. The contribution of non-prompt leptons to the signal selection is studied in \ttbar events, where the two b-jets are a source for leptons from heavy flavour decays. 

All events where at least one of the leptons is not matched to a generated electron or muon and/or does not originate directly or via an intermediate $\tau$ lepton from a \W boson are considered non-prompt. The resulting \mll distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nonPromptMC} for the inclusive dilepton selection (see Section~\ref{sec:inclusiveSelection}) on the left and the combined central and forward signal regions on the right. Good agreement between SF and OF pairs can be seen, with a slight tendency towards more OF.

\label{fig:nonPromptMC}
\end{figure} 
The event yields are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:nonPromptTableMC}. The contribution of non-prompt electrons exceeds that of non-prompt muons. Nevertheless, the event yields for SF and OF lepton pairs are very similar, the OF yields being higher by 5-10\%. This indicates that this type of backgrounds is slightly overpredicted by the estimates for flavour-symmetric backgrounds, which are therefore a conservative estimate for this type of background, at least in simulation. 
\input{tab/table_nonPromptMC}

\paragraph*{Testing the flavour-symmetry of non-prompt leptons on data}
The contribution of non-prompt leptons to the signal selection can be estimated on data from control samples enriched in non-prompt leptons~\cite{fakesnote1,fakesnote2}. These samples are obtained by relaxing the isolation requirements on the leptons from $\frac{\text{Iso}}{\pt} < 0.15$ (``tight'') to $\frac{\text{Iso}}{\pt}<1.0$ (``loose''). In this defintion, every tight lepton is also a loose lepton. The probabilities of a prompt or non-prompt lepton that passes the loose selection to pass also the default tight selection are often referred to as ``fake rate'' $0 < f< 1$ for non-prompt leptons and ``prompt rate'' $0< p< 1$ for prompt leptons. They are calculated as tight-to-loose ratios in two control regions defined below that are enriched in either prompt or non-prompt leptons:
\begin{eqnarray}
f = \frac{N_{\text{tight}}}{N_{\text{loose}}} (\text{non-prompt sample}),\text{                }  p = \frac{N_{\text{tight}}}{N_{\text{loose}}} (\text{prompt sample}).
\end{eqnarray} 
The fake rate $f$ is calculated on an event sample collected with prescaled low-\pt single lepton triggers (see Section~\ref{sec:trigger}). At least one jet with $\pt > \unit{50}{\giga\electronvolt}$ is required. To reject prompt leptons from \Wjets events, \MET and the transverse mass of the lepton-\MET system are both required to be less than $\unit{20}{\giga\electronvolt}$. The resulting fake rates as a function of lepton \pt and $\eta$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fakeRate}. For low \pt, the value for electrons is about 0.25 while for muons it is about 0.07. Dependencies on both \pt and $\eta$ are observed. The fake rate is therefore measured and applied as a function of both variables. The increase for higher \pt is however understood as arising from an increasing contamination from prompt leptons. Therefore, for all leptons with $\unit{\pt > 40}{\giga\electronvolt}$, the values measured for $\unit{35}{\giga\electronvolt} < \pt < \unit{40}{\giga\electronvolt}$ are used.

\caption{Measured fake rate for electrons (left) and muons (right) as a function of the \pt (top) and $\eta$ (bottom) of the lepton.}
\label{fig:fakeRate}
\end{figure} 

Similarly, to calculate the prompt rate, a sample enriched in prompt lepton is selected by requiring exactly two reconstructed leptons, of which the leading one is required to be a tight lepton, tagging the event as a \Z boson candidate, while the trailing one is a loose lepton. To further enrich the sample in prompt leptons from \Z boson decays, \mll is required to be within $\unit{15}{\giga\electronvolt}$ of the \Z boson mass and \MET is required to be $\unit{<20}{\giga\electronvolt}$. The resulting prompt ratios $p$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:promptRate}. They are again derived as functions of \pt and $\eta$. For low \pt they are about 0.85 for muons and 0.9 for electrons and approach values close to one for $\pt > \unit{60}{\giga\electronvolt}$ for both flavours. The systematic uncertainty assigned to the tight-to-loose ratios in the sources cited above is 50\%. As the definition of loose electrons differs from that used in the analyses referred above and modifications have been made to the definition of the control samples in which the ratios are measured, this number is not directly applicable here. However, the overall normalisation of the non-prompt background is not the focus of this study. Therefore no attempt is made to evaluate this uncertainty for this analysis and no systematic uncertainty is quoted.

\label{fig:promptRate}
\end{figure} 
Assuming universal fake and tight rates for simplicity, the number of observed events with two tight lepton ($N_{tt}$), one tight and one loose lepton ($N_{tl}$) and two loose leptons ($N_{ll}$) can be expressed in terms of the total numbers of events with two prompt ($N_{pp}^{*}$), one prompt and one non-prompt ($N_{pn}^{*}$), and two non-prompt ($N_{nn}^{*}$): 
\begin{align*}
N_{tt} &= p^2N_{pp}^{*} + pf N_{pn}^{*} + f^2N_{nn}^{*},\\
N_{tl} &= 2p(1-p)N_{pp}^{*} + [f(1-p)+p(-1f)]N_{pn}^{*} + 2f(1-f)N_{nn}^{*},\\
N_{ll} &= (1-p)^2N_{pp}^{*} + (1-p)(1-f)N_{pn}^{*} + (1-f)^2N_{nn}^{*}.
\end{align*}
This can be inverted to obtain expressions for $N_{pp}^{*}$, $N_{pn}^{*}$, and $N_{nn}^{*}$: 
\begin{align*}
N_{pp}^{*} &= \frac{1}{(p-f)^2}[(1-f)^2N_{tt}-f(1-f)N_{tl}+f^2N_{ll}],\\
N_{pn}^{*} &= \frac{1}{(p-f)^2}[-2(1-p)(1-f)N_{tt}-[f(1-p)+p(1-f)]N_{tl}-2fpN_{ll}],\\
N_{nn}^{*} &= \frac{1}{(p-f)^2}[(1-p)^2N_{tt}-p(1-p)N_{tl}+p^2N_{ll}].
\end{align*}
The yields observed inside the tight selection are then given by multiplying with the appropriate tight and fake rates:
\begin{align*}
N_{pp} &= ppN_{pp}^{*},\\
N_{pn} &= pfN_{pn}^{*},\\
N_{nn} &= ffN_{nn}^{*}.\\
\end{align*}
In practice, it has to be considered that the prompt and fake rates depend on the kinematic properties and the flavour of the two leptons. Using the measured fake and prompt rates $f_{1,2}$ and $p_{1,2}$, the contributions of the four possible combinations of prompt and non-prompt leptons (prompt-prompt, prompt-non-prompt, non-prompt-prompt, and non-prompt-non-prompt) are calculated using the following formulas
\begin{eqnarray*}
N_{pp} = \frac{(N_{tt}\cdot(f_1 -1)(f_2-1) + N_{tl}\cdot(f_1 -1)f_2 + N_{lt}\cdot (f_2-1)f_1 + N_{ll}\cdot f_1f_2)p_1p_2}{(f_1-p_1)(f_2-p_2)},\\
N_{pn} = \frac{(N_{tt}\cdot(f_1 -1)(1-p_2) - N_{tl}\cdot(f_1 -1)p_2 + N_{lt}\cdot (1-p_2)f_1 - N_{ll}\cdot f_1p_2)p_1f_2}{(f_1-p_1)(f_2-p_2)},\\
N_{np} = \frac{(N_{tt}\cdot(1 - p_1)(f_2 - 1) + N_{tl}\cdot(1-p_1)f_2 - N_{lt}\cdot (f_2-1)p_1 - N_{ll}\cdot f_2p_1)f_1p_2}{(f_1-p_1)(f_2-p_2)},\\
N_{nn} = \frac{(N_{tt}\cdot(1-p_1)(1-p_2) - N_{tl}\cdot (1-p_1)p_2 - N_{lt}\cdot (1-p_2)p_1 + N_{ll}\cdot p_1p_2)f_1f_2}{(f_1-p_1)(f_2-p_2)}.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
As the fake and prompt rates depend on \pt and $\eta$ of the leptons, in practice each event is assigned a weight based on whether the leptons are tight or loose as a function of their kinematic properties according to the formulas above. The estimates for the number of events are obtained as the sums of these weights. The first index indicates the trailing and the second the leading lepton. The total contribution of non-prompt backgrounds is given by the sum of $N_{pn}$, $N_{np}$, and $N_{nn}$. The resulting estimates in the central and forward signal regions are shown in Table~\ref{tab:nonPromptTable}. 
\input{tab/table_nonPrompt.tex}
The contribution of non-prompt leptons is small compared to the total number of tight lepton pairs and the estimates are well compatible between SF and OF events within the statistical uncertainties. This type of backgrounds is therefore accounted for by the background estimates for flavour-symmetric backgrounds.

\section{Drell--Yan backgrounds}
To estimate the contribution of Drell--Yan backgrounds (see Section~\ref{sec:SMBackgrounds}) to the event sample in the signal region, both the Jet-\Z balance (\JZB) and \MET templates methods~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012qka} are used. They are designed to describe the \MET distribution in this category of backgrounds and focus on the description of the on-Z region. The first studies the balance of \Z boson candidates against the jets in the event. In the \MET template method, the \MET distribution of \gjets events are used to estimate that of \zjets events. As the development and application of these methods have not been part of the work covered in this thesis, only a short description will be given. The reported results are those obtained on the first reconstruction of the dataset published in~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lwa}, corrected for slight differences in event kinematics in the two reconstruction versions. 
\subsection{JZB method}
The \JZB variable is defined as the balance of the \pt of the jets in the event with the \pt of the $\Z\rightarrow \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ candidate. To avoid biases due to jet selection, \METVec is used as a measure of the hadronic recoil of the \Z boson:
\begin{equation}
\JZB = \abs{ \sum\limits_{\mathrm{jets}}\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}} } - \abs{ \vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{ }\mathrm{Z}}} \approx \abs{ \vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} -  \vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{ }\mathrm{ Z}}} - \abs{\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\text{ }\mathrm{Z}}} .
\end{equation}
For SM processes such as \zjets, with $\Z \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$, where \MET is caused by mismeasurements of the jets, the \JZB distribution is symmetric around 0. For BSM processes, where the \Z boson is produced correlated with invisible particles, the \JZB distribution is expected to be asymmetric, favouring a positive sign especially for large values of \JZB and, by extension, high \MET. Therefore, it is possible to predict the contribution of SM processes containing a \Z boson at high \MET from the events in that region with negative values of \JZB. In both region, backgrounds from flavour-symmetric processes are subtracted from OF events. This results in a final estimate of 
\begin{equation*}
N_{\JZB}^{\text{pred}} = N_{\JZB < 0}+ N_{\JZB > 0}^{\text{pred}} = 2\cdot N_{\JZB < 0} - N_{\JZB < 0}^{OF}\cdot \Rsfof - N_{\JZB > 0}^{OF}\cdot \Rsfof. 
\end{equation*}
 The assumption that the \JZB distribution is symmetric around 0 for SM processes with only instrumental \MET is studied in MC and 20\% systematic uncertainty are assigned~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lwa}.
\subsection{\MET templates method}
The \MET templates method utilises the similarity of \zjets and \gjets events, especially the fact that mismeasurement is the only source of \MET in both cases. Therefore, after corrections for residual kinematic differences, the contribution of \zjets events at high \MET can be estimated from \gjets events passing the same selection. Signals producing both \Z bosons and photons are therefore at least partially included in these estimates. However, this would result in discrepancies between the \JZB and \MET templates results, retaining some sensitivity to this kind of models. The dominant systematic uncertainties are assigned based on tests of the method on simulation and are in the order of 15-100\% for \MET values falling into the signal selection of this analysis. The large uncertainties for higher \MET values are driven by the available number of simulated events to validate the method. 

In contrast to the \JZB method, the \MET templates method does only account for \zjets events. Other backgrounds containing \Z bosons, such as \WZ, \ZZ or more rare SM processes like $t\bar{t}\mathrm{Z}$ or triboson production are estimated from simulation and assigned 50\% uncertainty~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lwa}. The full Drell--Yan prediction from the \MET templates in a given event selection is therefore given by
\begin{equation*}
N_{\MET\text{ templates}}^{\text{pred}} = N_{\gjets}\cdot\text{kinematic corrections} + N_{\text{Diboson, rare SM}}^{\text{MC}} - N_{OF}\cdot \Rsfof. 
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Extrapolation to off-Z regions}
\label{sec:ROutIn}
Both methods described above result in background estimates for the on-\Z region (81\GeV $< \mll < $ 101\GeV). Contributions to the low-mass and high-mass selections from off-shell \Z bosons or the Drell--Yan continuum are estimated by applying an extrapolation factor \Routin to the on-\Z prediction. This approach relies on the assumption that the \mll distribution of Drell--Yan events, and especially the ratio of the contribution on the \Z boson peak to that at lower or higher masses, is the same independent of \MET and \njets. \Routin is measured in the Drell--Yan control region, separately for the low-mass and high-mass region as well as for \EE, \MM, and SF leptons. It is defined as the ratio of the event yield in the mass region in question (\textit{out}) by that in the on-\Z mass region (\textit{in}), after subtraction of the contribution from flavour-symmetric processes from the OF sample:
\begin{equation}
\Routin = \frac{\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{out}}^{\mathrm{SF}} - \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{out}}^{\mathrm{OF}}\Rsfof}{ \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{in}}^{\mathrm{SF}} - \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{in}}^{\mathrm{OF}}\Rsfof},
\end{equation} 
where the SF can be substituted by \EE or \MM according to the desired lepton flavour. The \mll distribution in the Drell--Yan control region is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rOutIn}. The resulting values range from about 6-7\% for the low-mass region to 2-3\% for the high-mass region, as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:rOutIn}.

The black lines indicate the boundaries of the two \textit{out} regions and the dark red lines those of the \textit{in} region.}
\label{fig:rOutIn}
\end{figure} 
\input{tab/table_ROutIn.tex}
The validity of applying the \Routin as measured in the Drell--Yan control region in the signal region is checked by studying the behaviour of the quantity as a function of \MET and \njets. The results for the low-mass selection and the case of SF leptons is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ROutInDependencies} for both the central and forward lepton selections. In neither selection a dependency on \MET is observed. However, above 70\GeV there is not enough statistics left after subtraction of the flavour-symmetric backgrounds, so it is not possible to judge the behaviour all the way up to the signal region. The value of \Routin clearly increases with the number of jets. As the requirement on \njets is very similar between the Drell--Yan control region and the signal region, the events do not differ much in terms of jet multiplicity and this dependency does not restrict the applicability of the \Routin factors in the signal region. In total, a systematic uncertainty of 25\% is assigned to cover the observed effects. Consistent results are observed also for the high-mass region and for the split into \EE and \MM, as can be seen in Appendix~\ref{app:routin}.

\subsection{Resulting background prediction}
The predictions for the on-\Z region from the \JZB and \MET templates methods agree within their uncertainties, as can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:dyResults}. As for the \Rsfof factor, a weighted average is used to combine the two estimates. The results of both methods as well as the combination are shown in Table~\ref{tab:dyResults}. Shown are also the \Routin values and the resulting estimates for the low- and high-mass regions. In this analysis a different reconstruction version of the data is used, compared to the one used in~\cite{Khachatryan:2015lwa}. Therefore, the on-\Z predictions, which are taken from the published result, are scaled by 1.03$\pm$0.03 to take into account a slight increase in jet multiplicity observed in the present dataset.
